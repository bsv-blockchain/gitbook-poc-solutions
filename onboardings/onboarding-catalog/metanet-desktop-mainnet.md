![BSV Desktop Initial Screen](../../assets/onboardings/bsv-desktop/bsv-desktop-main.png)

To begin creating your wallet, click on **Configure Wallet**.

### Choose Your Wallet Type

BSV Desktop offers two distinct ways to create and manage your identity. Choose the one that fits your needs:

#### 1. WAB (Wallet Authentication Backend) - Recommended
*   **Easy Recovery:** Uses your phone number. If you lose your device, you can recover your wallet easily.
*   **Welcome Gift:** You receive a small amount of Satoshis to get started immediately.
*   **User Experience:** Streamlined and user-friendly.

#### 2. Mnemonic (Traditional)
*   **Self-Sovereign:** No phone number required.
*   **Manual Recovery:** You are solely responsible for your recovery phrase (12 words). If you lose it, your funds are lost forever.
*   **No Gift:** You must fund the wallet yourself before using it.

### Option A: WAB Setup (Recommended)

1.  **Configuration**:
    In the configuration screen, ensure the **Network** is set to `Mainnet` (or `Testnet` for development).
    
    ![WAB Configuration](../../assets/onboardings/bsv-desktop/bsv-desktop-wab-config.png) 
    
    *   **WAB Server**: Defines the identity provider. Default: `https://wab.babbage.systems`. Click **Refresh Info** to update server details.
    *   **Remote Storage**: Your wallet balance and history can be stored on a secure remote server (`https://storage.babbage.systems`) or locally. Remote is recommended for cross-device access.
    *   **Messagebox**: The communication hub for peer-to-peer transactions and token transfers. Default: `https://messagebox.babbage.systems`.

2.  **Verification**:
    After applying settings, click **Create new Identity**. You will be asked to enter your phone number.
    
    ![WAB Verification](../../assets/onboardings/bsv-desktop/bsv-desktop-wab-account.png)
    
    Enter the code received via SMS. Once verified, your wallet is ready and funded!

### Option B: Mnemonic Setup

1.  **Configuration**:
    Select **"I prefer to use a mnemonic presentation key"**.
    
    ![Mnemonic Configuration](../../assets/onboardings/bsv-desktop/bsv-desktop-mnemonic-config.png)
    
    Click **Apply Configuration** to proceed.

2.  **Generate Key**:
    Click on **Generate Random Mnemonic**.
    
    ![Generate Mnemonic](../../assets/onboardings/bsv-desktop/bsv-desktop-mnemonic-account.png)
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > **Write down your mnemonic phrase and store it safely.** This is the ONLY way to recover your wallet.

3.  **Confirm**:
    Verify you have saved your phrase.
    
    ![Mnemonic Example](../../assets/onboardings/bsv-desktop/bsv-desktop-mnemonic-key.png)
    
    Click **Continue**.

4.  **Fund Your Wallet**:
    Unlike WAB, a mnemonic wallet starts empty. You will see a funding screen.
    
    ![Fund Wallet](../../assets/onboardings/bsv-desktop/bsv-desktop-mnemonic-fund.png)
    
    You must send BSV to the displayed address to activate the wallet.
