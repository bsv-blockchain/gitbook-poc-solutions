You can deposit:

### 4️⃣ Buy BSV on the Spot Market

#### 4.1 Transfer USDT to Trading Account

Kucoin uses the **Spot Market** for buying BSV.
Spot trading means buying or selling crypto at the current market price.

- First, transfer your deposited funds to your **Trading Account** ([Kucoin Trading Account](https://www.kucoin.com/assets/trade-account)).
- It’s recommended to use **USDT** (Tether), as BSV is traded against USDT (BSV/USDT pair).

> **Why USDT?**
> The BSV/USDT pair means you exchange USDT for BSV. For example, if 1 BSV = 10 USDT, buying 0.1 BSV costs 1 USDT.

---

#### 4.2 Exchange USDT for BSV

- Go to [Kucoin BSV/USDT Spot Market](https://www.kucoin.com/trade/BCHSV-USDT).
- Make sure you select **BSV/USDT** as the trading pair.

- On the right, select **Spot**, then **Buy**, and choose **Market** (to buy at the current price).
- Enter the amount of USDT you want to spend.
- Click **BUY** to complete your purchase.

> **Example:**
> If you want to buy 0.5 BSV and the price is 10 USDT per BSV, you’ll need 5 USDT.

---

#### 4.3 Check Your BSV Balance

Return to your [Trading Account](https://www.kucoin.com/assets/trade-account) to see your BSV balance.

---

### 5️⃣ Withdraw BSV to Your Wallet

To transfer BSV to your personal wallet:

- Go to your **Trading Account** and click **Withdraw**.
- Select **BSV** as the coin.
- Enter your BSV wallet address (double-check for accuracy!).
