## About BSV Applications

The BSV blockchain enables a new generation of applications that leverage micropayments, data ownership, and on-chain functionality. These applications demonstrate the practical capabilities of blockchain technology for everyday use cases, from payments and identity to storage and AI services.

### Key Benefits of BSV Apps

- **Micropayments:** Pay only for what you use with fraction-of-a-cent transactions
- **Data Ownership:** Your data stored immutably on-chain
- **Transparency:** Verifiable transactions and interactions
- **No Subscriptions:** Most apps use pay-as-you-go models instead of monthly fees
- **Interoperability:** Apps can work together using BSV blockchain standards
