## 1. What Is Metanet ToDo?

Metanet ToDo is a unique task management application that turns your to-do list into incentivized blockchain commitments. By attaching satoshi rewards to tasks, you create financial motivation to complete your goals. When you mark a task as done, the locked satoshis are released, providing both accomplishment and reward.

**Key Features:**
- **Incentivized Tasks** - Lock satoshis when creating tasks, release them upon completion
- **Real-time Progress** - Visual indicators show task status and completion
- **Blockchain Commitment** - Tasks are recorded on BSV blockchain for accountability
- **Celebration Rewards** - Get satisfying notifications when completing tasks
- **Minimum Value** - Set at 1 satoshi minimum for maximum flexibility
- **BSV Wallet Integration** - Works seamlessly with BRC-100 compatible wallets

**Target Users:** Anyone looking for extra motivation to complete tasks - developers, students, professionals, and anyone who wants to gamify productivity with real financial incentives.
