## 1. What Is ToolBSV?

ToolBSV is a revolutionary AI platform that replaces expensive subscriptions with **BSV micropayments**. Instead of paying monthly fees regardless of usage, you only pay for what you actually use - whether that's generating text, creating images, or producing videos.

**Key Features:**
- **Chat AI** with multiple language models
- **Image Generation** using various AI models with customizable sizes
- **Video Creation** with different generation engines and quality settings
- **Micropayment System** - pay per interaction, not per month
- **Cost Transparency** - see exactly what each model costs before using it
- **On-chain Persistence** - your interactions are securely stored on BSV blockchain

**Target Users:** Anyone seeking cost-effective AI tools without subscription commitments - developers, content creators, businesses, and individual users who want flexible, pay-as-you-go AI services.
