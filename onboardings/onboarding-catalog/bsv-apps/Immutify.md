## 1. What Is Immutify?

Immutify is a powerful blockchain-based proof-of-existence platform that enables you to create cryptographically secure, timestamped records of ideas, documents, and media on the BSV blockchain. By creating an immutable proof of your intellectual property at a specific point in time, Immutify provides verifiable evidence that can be used for copyright protection, patent documentation, creative work authentication, and legal purposes.

**Key Features:**
- **Cryptographic Proof-of-Existence** - Create blockchain-verified timestamps for any content
- **Text and Media Support** - Prove ownership of ideas, documents, images, videos, and audio
- **Private Mode** - Store only the cryptographic hash, keeping content confidential
- **Hash Verification** - Verify the authenticity of previously immutified content
- **Blockchain Timestamping** - Immutable, tamper-proof records with precise timestamps
- **Intellectual Property Protection** - Establish priority claims for innovations and creations
- **Legal Documentation** - Create verifiable proof for legal and compliance purposes

**Target Users:** Inventors, creators, writers, artists, researchers, businesses, and anyone needing to prove they possessed specific information at a particular time. Essential for intellectual property protection, prior art documentation, creative work authentication, and compliance record-keeping.

## 2. Before You Begin

### Prerequisites
- **BSV Wallet:** BSV Desktop Wallet for payment of blockchain storage fees
- **Web Browser:** Modern browser with JavaScript enabled
- **Content to Protect:** Ideas, documents, images, or media you want to timestamp
- **BSV Balance:** Small amount of BSV for blockchain transaction fees

### Supported Platforms
- **Web-based:** Access via https://immutify.metanet.app/
- **Cross-platform:** Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **No Installation Required:** Pure web application

### Understanding Proof-of-Existence
Before using Immutify, understand the key concepts:
- **Hash:** A unique cryptographic fingerprint of your content
- **Timestamp:** The exact date and time recorded on blockchain
- **Immutability:** Once recorded, the proof cannot be altered or deleted
- **Privacy:** In private mode, only the hash is stored, not your actual content
- **Verification:** Anyone can verify a proof using the original content or hash

## 3. Getting Started: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Access Immutify
1. Navigate to **https://immutify.metanet.app/** in your web browser
2. The Immutify main interface loads
3. Ensure your BSV Desktop Wallet is running for payment processing
4. Review the main dashboard options

### Step 2: Choose Your Content Type
Immutify supports multiple content types for proof creation:

**Text-Based Content:**
- Written ideas and concepts
- Document text and manuscripts
- Code snippets and algorithms
- Business plans and proposals
- Research notes and findings

**Media Content:**
- Images and photographs
- Video files
- Audio recordings
- Design files
- Any digital file format

### Step 3: Create Your First Immutable Proof

#### For Text Content:
1. Select **"Create Immutable Proof"** option
2. Choose **Text/Idea** mode
3. Enter your content in the text field:
   - Type or paste your idea
   - Include as much detail as needed
   - Add identifiers like project names or version numbers
4. Review your content carefully (this will be what's hashed)
5. Decide between **Public** or **Private** mode:
   - **Public:** Content stored on blockchain (fully transparent)
   - **Private:** Only hash stored (content remains confidential)

#### For Media Content:
1. Select **"Create Immutable Proof"** for media
2. Click **Upload** or drag and drop your file
3. Supported formats typically include:
   - Images: JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.
   - Video: MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.
   - Audio: MP3, WAV, etc.
   - Documents: PDF, DOCX, etc.
4. Choose **Private** mode for sensitive files (recommended)
5. The system generates a cryptographic hash of your file

### Step 4: Submit to Blockchain
1. Review your proof details:
   - Content or file name
   - Privacy setting
   - Estimated blockchain fee
2. Click **"Submit to Blockchain"** or **"Create Proof"**
3. BSV Desktop Wallet prompts for payment confirmation
4. **Approve the transaction** (typically a very small fee)
5. Wait for blockchain confirmation (usually seconds to minutes)
6. Your proof is now permanently timestamped on BSV blockchain

**Important Notes:**
- Once submitted, the proof cannot be removed or altered
- Save your proof details and transaction ID
- In private mode, keep your original content safe for future verification
- The timestamp proves you possessed this content at this specific moment

### Step 5: Save Your Proof Details
After successful submission, Immutify provides:
1. **Transaction ID (TXID)** - Blockchain record reference
2. **Cryptographic Hash** - Unique fingerprint of your content
3. **Timestamp** - Exact date and time of proof creation
4. **Blockchain Link** - Direct link to view transaction on block explorer

**Save these details securely:**
- Screenshot the confirmation page
- Copy and save the TXID and hash
- Download any provided certificates
- Store in multiple secure locations

### Step 6: Verify Document or Media Hash
To verify existing content or check if something has been immutified:

1. Navigate to the **"Verify Hash"** section
2. Choose verification method:
   - **Upload original file** for automatic hash comparison
   - **Enter hash directly** if you have the hash value
3. Click **"Verify"** or **"Check Hash"**
4. Immutify searches the blockchain
5. Results show:
   - **Match found:** Content was immutified with timestamp details
   - **No match:** Content has no existing proof on blockchain

**Verification Use Cases:**
- Prove when you created something
- Verify authenticity of received documents
- Check if content has been previously registered
- Validate timestamps for legal purposes
- Confirm content hasn't been tampered with

## 5. Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Hash verification fails | Wrong file or modified content | Ensure exact original file is used; any modification changes hash |
| Upload too slow | Large file size | Compress files when possible; private mode only uploads hash |
| Payment doesn't process | Wallet not connected | Launch BSV Desktop and ensure connection; check BSV balance |
| Hash mismatch error | Content altered since proof | Verify you're using the exact original content, including metadata |
| Cannot find proof | Incorrect hash or TXID | Double-check hash format; verify TXID from original confirmation |
| Blockchain confirmation delayed | Network congestion | Wait a few minutes; BSV typically confirms quickly but delays can occur |

### Tips for Effective Use
- **Document Everything:** Keep detailed records of all proofs created
- **Regular Backups:** Maintain backups of TXIDs, hashes, and original content
- **Consistent Formatting:** Use consistent file formats to avoid hash mismatches
- **Metadata Awareness:** File metadata can affect hashes; preserve original files exactly
- **Test Verification:** Verify your proofs immediately after creation to ensure process works
