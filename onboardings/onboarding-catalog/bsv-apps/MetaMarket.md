## 1. What Is MetaMarket?

MetaMarket is a decentralized marketplace built on the BSV blockchain for uploading, sharing, and selling files and data.

**Key Features:**
- **File/Data Upload** - Share any type of file or data with custom descriptions and pricing
- **Decentralized Marketplace** - No intermediaries, direct creator-to-buyer transactions
- **Browsable Catalog** - Searchable and filterable file listings
- **Custom Pricing** - Set your own prices in satoshis for each upload
- **Account Management** - Manage your uploads and notification preferences
- **Blockchain Persistence** - All listings and transactions recorded on BSV
- **BSV Micropayments** - Enable pay-per-download monetization

**Target Users:** Content creators, developers, data providers, and anyone looking to monetize digital files and datasets through a decentralized marketplace without platform fees or intermediaries.
