# 🗄️ UHRP Storage Guide

Welcome to the UHRP Storage onboarding!
Here you’ll learn how to securely store and validate data on BSV Blockchain using the [UHRP Storage app](https://uhrp-ui.bapp.dev/), following the UHRP protocol ([specification](https://bsv.brc.dev/overlays/0026)).

## 🌐 What is UHRP?

**UHRP (Universal HTTP Resource Protocol)** is a protocol for decentralized, secure, and verifiable file storage on BSV Blockchain.
It allows you to upload files, generate unique UHRP URLs for access, and ensure data integrity—making your files tamper-proof and always available.

- **Decentralized:** Files are stored across multiple servers, not just one provider.
- **Verifiable:** Every file has a unique UHRP URL, which proves its authenticity and integrity.
- **Compatible:** Works seamlessly with BSV Desktop for payments and identity.

## 🔗 UHRP URL: Your File’s Unique Link

Once payment is complete, you’ll receive a **UHRP URL**—a unique link to your file, proving its authenticity and allowing easy access.
