## 1. What Is Paymail.us?

Paymail.us (Paymail Bridge) is a user-friendly platform that simplifies BSV payments by providing memorable paymail addresses.

**Key Features:**
- **Simple Paymail Registration** - Create your unique `@paymail.us` address
- **Easy Payment Collection** - Receive BSV payments using your memorable paymail
- **Instant Sending** - Send BSV to any paymail address with just a name and amount
- **Transaction History** - Track all incoming and outgoing payments
- **No Complex Addresses** - Share your paymail instead of long Bitcoin addresses

**Target Users:** Anyone who wants to simplify BSV payments - individuals, businesses, content creators, and developers who need an easy way to send and receive Bitcoin payments without dealing with complex addresses.

## 2. Before You Begin

### Prerequisites
- **BSV Wallet:** BRC-100 compatible wallet (Metanet Desktop recommended)
- **Web Browser:** Modern browser with JavaScript enabled
- **BSV Balance:** Small amount of BSV for payments (transactions cost fractions of cents)

### Supported Platforms
- **Web-based:** Access via https://paymail.us/
- **Cross-platform:** Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **No Installation Required:** Pure web application

### Understanding Paymail
Paymail is a protocol that makes Bitcoin addresses as easy to use as email addresses. Instead of:
- Complex address: `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`
- You use paymail: `alice@paymail.us`

This makes it much easier to share and remember payment addresses.
