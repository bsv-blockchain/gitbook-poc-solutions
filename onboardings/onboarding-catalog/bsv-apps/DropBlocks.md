# DropBlocks Onboarding Guide

DropBlocks is a decentralized file storage application leveraging BSV Blockchain and the UHRP protocol for permanent, verifiable file storage.
Files are stored off-chain, referenced by UHRP URLs, and timestamped on BSV.

## Key Features
- Decentralized file catalog: uploads, renewals, export/import
- UHRP URLs for content integrity
- Folders, encryption, sharing

## Getting Started

1. Visit [https://dropblocks.org/](https://dropblocks.org/)
2. Open **Settings**
   - Set wallet host (localhost for desktop/mobile IP for mobile)
   - Fund wallet with BSV
3. **Upload a file**
   - Click “New File”
   - Set retention and encryption options
   - Upload document
4. **Organize and renew**
   - Move files to folders
   - Click “Renew” for expiring files
   - Use “Export” to backup your catalog
