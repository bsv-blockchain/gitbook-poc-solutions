## 🏦 How Payments Work

BSV Desktop is your gateway to the BSV Blockchain ecosystem.
While the wallet itself is for managing your identity and applications, payments are made through connected apps like [PeerPay](https://peerpay.babbage.systems/).

## 🚀 Sending Payments

1. **Open BSV Desktop** and go to [PeerPay](https://peerpay.babbage.systems/).
    PeerPay will automatically detect your wallet.
