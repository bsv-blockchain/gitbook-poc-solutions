# Onboardings Space

Welcome to the Onboardings hubâ€”a curated gateway for users to discover, understand, and activate production-ready applications and solutions.

Unlike the demo catalog, this space is focused on orienting users to working solutionsâ€”not just proof-of-concepts or educational content. Solutions here deliver business, technical, and operational impact from day one.

## What Is This Space?

- **Introductory onboarding:** Briefs for each solution to set clear expectations and ease initial engagement.
- **For all audiences:** Onboards any user with simple, non-role-specific guidance.
- **Solution-centric navigation:** Move beyond theoretical trainingâ€”find real, actionable technology for real problems.
