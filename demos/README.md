## Active Demos

| Use Case | Demo Name | Description | Links | Last Updated |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| **Data Integrity & Hashing** | Truth Machine | This application demonstrates secure data integrity and timestamping on the BSV Blockchain. Upload a file, and its cryptographic hash is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable proof of existence at that exact time. Files are stored in a regular database and can be retrieved later with verifiable evidence of their creation date and integrity. The Treasury section enables token creation to fund transaction fees for the service. | • [Business](demo-catalog/truth-machine/business-truth-machine.md) • [Technical](demo-catalog/truth-machine/technical-truth-machine.md) | Aug 2025 |
| **Supply Chain Tracking** | Natural Chain | A natural gas supply chain proof of concept system leveraging the BSV blockchain that creates an incentivized data-provenance tracking for methane emissions across different supply chain stages. The demo shows how each party can view history, confirm/acknowledge receipt of items, triggering new transaction states with unique transaction IDs (txid). | • [Business](demo-catalog/natural-chain/business-natural-chain.md) • [Technical](demo-catalog/natural-chain/technical-natural-chain.md) | Aug 2025 |
| **Healthcare Tokenization** | Prescription Tokens | A prescription token proof-of-concept using BSV blockchain that creates secure, transferable prescription ownership. This demo serves as a precursor to identity solutions, built entirely with BSV stack components and demonstrating remote rootKey-based WalletClient over JSON RPC. Built for QuarkID/BlockMed. | • [Business](demo-catalog/prescription-tokens/business-prescription-tokens.md) • [Technical](demo-catalog/prescription-tokens/technical-prescription-tokens.md) | Aug 2025 |
| **Medical Data Exchange** | P2P Medical | Peer-to-peer medical data exchange system demonstrating secure patient data sharing and interoperability between healthcare providers using BSV blockchain for data integrity and access control. | • [Business](demo-catalog/p2p-medical/business-p2p-medical.md) • [Technical](demo-catalog/p2p-medical/technical-p2p-medical.md) | Aug 2025 |
| **Digital Identity** | Register | Digital identity management system showcasing decentralized identity creation, verification, and management capabilities on BSV blockchain for secure user authentication and credential management. | • [Business](demo-catalog/register/business-register.md) • [Technical](demo-catalog/register/technical-register.md) | Aug 2025 |
