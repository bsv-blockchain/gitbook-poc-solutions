# Sovereign Data Ownership Tied to Identity (SOLID + BSV) - Business Overview

**Demo ID**: `demo-2025-09`
**Status**: `In progress`
**Last Updated**: `2025-09-05`

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Users today lack true ownership and control over their personal data, which is often siloed in centralized systems that limit transparency, privacy, and control. Current knowledge management solutions do not fully empower users with sovereignty over their data.

### Solution Overview
This proof of concept integrates SOLID personal data pods—decentralized data vaults controlled by users—with the BSV blockchain to establish a secure, tamper-proof foundation for personal knowledge management. Through public timestamping, notarization, and micropayments powered by BSV, users retain ownership and control while enabling verifiable proof of data existence, governance, and usage traceability.

### Key Benefits
- **User Sovereignty**: Enables users to control, share, and monetize their data stored in personal SOLID pods
- **Immutable Audit Trails**: Public blockchain timestamps ensure data integrity and governance
- **Decentralized Trust**: Enhances security and privacy through decentralization and cryptographic guarantees
- **Flexible Usage Models**: Supports pay-per-use storage and content sharing with micropayment incentives
- **Seamless AI Integration**: Facilitates intelligent data usage while respecting user consent and rights

## Business Impact

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Individual users seeking control over personal knowledge and data
- **Secondary**: Developers of decentralized apps (dApps), privacy-conscious consumers, AI service providers

### Success Metrics
| Metric                        | Baseline                 | Target                          | Timeline          |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| User adoption of personal pods| Pilot user count         | Steady growth in active users   | 6-12 months       |
| Verified blockchain timestamps| None                     | All user data interactions timestamped | 6-12 months  |
| Micropayment transactions     | 0                        | Regular pay-per-use transactions | 6-12 months       |

### ROI Analysis
- **Investment Required**: Development resources to build and integrate SOLID pods with BSV blockchain mechanisms, user onboarding.
- **Expected Return**: Increased user trust, new monetization opportunities for personal data, differentiated product positioning in privacy-first knowledge management.
- **Break-even Point**: To be determined based on pilot results and user engagement metrics.

## Implementation Roadmap
