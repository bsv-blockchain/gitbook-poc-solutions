# Preimage - Business Overview

**Demo ID**: `preimage`
**Status**: `Early Development`
**Last Updated**: `September 30, 2025`

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
BSV blockchain developers, particularly those working with sCrypt smart contracts, frequently encounter complex debugging challenges when working with transaction preimages and script code. Understanding the internal structure of transaction signatures, preimage components, and script assembly is critical for troubleshooting checkSig and checkPreimage exceptions, but current tools lack specialized interfaces for this analysis.

### Solution Overview
Preimage is an early-stage web application designed to parse and visualize BSV transaction preimages. Built using modern web technologies through the Lovable development platform, it aims to help developers inspect preimage components and understand BSV transaction signature mechanisms.

### Key Benefits
- **Advanced Debugging**: Deep inspection of transaction preimage components for sCrypt development
- **Script Analysis**: Convert complex script code to readable Assembly format
- **Signature Troubleshooting**: Identify discrepancies in checkSig and checkPreimage operations
- **Educational Resource**: Learn BSV transaction internals and signature mechanisms
- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce debugging time for complex smart contract issues

## Business Impact

### Target Users
- **Primary**: sCrypt smart contract developers and BSV application builders
- **Secondary**: Blockchain security auditors, researchers, and educational institutions

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeline |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| sCrypt Developer Adoption | 0 | 200+ active users | 6 months |
| Debug Sessions | 0 | 500+ monthly inspections | 6 months |
| Issue Resolution Time | N/A | 50% reduction in debugging time | 3 months |

### ROI Analysis
- **Investment Required**: Continued development using modern web stack and BSV expertise
- **Expected Return**: Educational value for BSV developers, debugging tool for ecosystem
- **Break-even Point**: Community adoption and contribution to BSV developer tooling

## Implementation Roadmap

### Current Status
- **Technology Stack**: Vite, TypeScript, React, shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Development Platform**: Built using Lovable development platform
- **Repository Status**: Public repository with basic scaffolding
- **Deployment**: Can be published through Lovable platform

### Development Roadmap
- Implement transaction preimage parsing functionality
- Add component breakdown visualization (nVersion, hashPrevouts, etc.)
- Create script code to Assembly (ASM) conversion tools
- Integrate BSV SDK for proper preimage handling
- Add debugging workflows and examples
