## Executive Summary

Register (BlockMed) is a comprehensive blockchain-based prescription management solution built on Bitcoin SV. It uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to securely create, share, and verify digital prescriptions and related healthcare authorizations.

---

## Problem Statement

Healthcare providers, patients, pharmacies, and insurers require secure, transparent, and tamper-proof workflows for managing prescriptions and medication history. Traditional paper or centralized digital systems are vulnerable to fraud, data loss, and lack efficient cross-entity coordination.

Register solves these issues by leveraging the Bitcoin SV blockchain and an overlay network to provide immutable tracking, identity validation, and controlled sharing of prescription data.

---

## How It Works

- Patients, doctors, pharmacies, and insurers are represented as actors with DIDs on the BSV overlay network.
- Doctors create prescriptions as verifiable credentials anchored on the blockchain.
- Patients share prescriptions securely with pharmacies which verify and dispense medication.
- Insurers confirm coverage by accessing authorized prescription copies.
- The system prevents fraud and double-spending through token-based transaction authority.

## Key Benefits

- **End-to-End Prescription Transparency:** Secure lifecycle from creation to dispensation.
- **Data Integrity & Authentication:** Immutable tracking anchored on BSV with strong cryptographic identity.
- **Fraud Prevention:** Prevents prescription duplication and unauthorized alterations.
- **Cross-Entity Workflow:** Facilitates seamless interaction between patients, doctors, pharmacies, and insurers.
