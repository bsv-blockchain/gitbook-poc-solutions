# Time Anchor with BSV Open Source Stack - Business Overview

**Demo ID**: `demo-2025-10`
**Status**: `In progress`
**Last Updated**: `2025-09-05`

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of software applications and data over time is critical for security, auditability, and trust. Current solutions often lack verifiable, immutable proof of existence and tamper evidence in a scalable and transparent manner.

### Solution Overview
This proof of concept leverages the BSV blockchain's scalability and security to anchor file checksums and metadata immutably on-chain. It expands upon base checksum verification with advanced Overlay Services integrating UHRP, BRC-26 token protocols, and storage management tools to track and maintain file integrity over time. Using WalletClient from the @bsv/sdk and BSV Desktop enables seamless blockchain transaction management for these anchored records.

### Key Benefits
- **Tamper Evident Records**: Immutable blockchain timestamps protect file integrity and application authenticity.
- **Scalable Verification**: BSV’s high throughput accommodates frequent anchoring and updates.
- **Open Source Tools**: Utilizes community-driven tools (StorageUploader, WalletClient, Overlay Services) for transparent management.
- **Extensible Metadata**: Supports advanced protocols (UHRP, BRC-26) for rich file tracking and governance.

## Business Impact

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Software developers, application security teams, compliance auditors
- **Secondary**: Enterprises requiring proof of authenticity, regulators, open-source communities

### Success Metrics
| Metric                         | Baseline               | Target                       | Timeline          |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Successfully anchored files    | None                   | All critical files anchored  | 6 months          |
| Integrity verification actions | Few or manual          | Automated periodic checks    | 6-12 months       |
| Adoption of open-source tools  | Pilot usage            | Increased community adoption | 12 months         |

### ROI Analysis
- **Investment Required**: Engineering resources to integrate checksum anchoring, deploy Overlay Services, and enable blockchain transaction handling.
- **Expected Return**: Reduced risk of undetected tampering, enhanced trust in software authenticity, and improved audit compliance.
- **Break-even Point**: To be validated through pilot deployment and operational cost savings.
