# Truth Machine

This application demonstrates secure data integrity and timestamping on the BSV Blockchain. Upload a file, and its cryptographic hash is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable proof of existence at that exact time. Files are stored in a regular database and can be retrieved later with verifiable evidence of their creation date and integrity. The Treasury section enables token creation to fund transaction fees for the service.
