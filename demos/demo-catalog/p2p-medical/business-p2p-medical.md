## Executive Summary

Secure Med Drop-Off is a web-based demo that showcases confidential peer-to-peer medical file sharing using blockchain security principles. Built on Bitcoin SV, it enables healthcare providers, patients, and authorized recipients to transfer sensitive medical documents while maintaining auditability, privacy, and absolute data integrity.

---

## Problem Statement

Healthcare organizations and patients face persistent challenges with traditional methods of medical file transfer—risks of data leakage, unauthorized access, lack of patient control, and poor audit trails. A blockchain-secured, patient-centric file sharing system is critical to enable trusted, privacy-compliant exchange outside of centralized silos.

---

## How It Works

- Users securely submit, share, and retrieve medical files via a browser-based interface.
- Each file drop-off and pick-up is logged and timestamped on the blockchain, proving the transaction's legitimacy.
- Role-based permissions ensure only authorized users can access submitted files.
- Data privacy is protected by in-transit and at-rest encryption; medical information is never exposed unintentionally.

---

## Key Benefits

- **Confidentiality & Control**: Users directly manage access and sharing of their own medical documents.
- **Transparent Audit Trails**: Every transfer is logged immutably on-chain; no more shadow access.
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Blockchain-based auditability, encryption, and user control help address HIPAA, GDPR, and similar regulations.
- **Trust & Integrity**: Recipients, senders, and auditors have cryptographic proof of each transaction and file status.

## Target Users

- Patients seeking private control over document sharing
- Healthcare clinics and providers exchanging records with patients or other institutions
- Insurance companies or specialists requesting verified medical documentation

---

## Use Cases

- Secure delivery of lab results or discharge summaries, directly to patients or other providers
- Sharing diagnostic images or reports for a second medical opinion
- Permission-based sharing for regulatory or insurance review
- Emergency access for authorized clinics with audit proof

---

## Current Impact

Secure Med Drop-Off demonstrates next-generation file sharing workflows in healthcare, balancing privacy, patient empowerment, and security. By leveraging the blockchain’s audit and transparency, it streamlines compliance and user trust.
