# Internal Token Transfer - Business Overview

**Demo ID**: `demo-2025-12`
**Status**: `In progress`
**Last Updated**: `2025-09-05`

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Decentralized file sharing faces challenges in incentivizing contributions and controlling content access. Traditional platforms lack efficient token-based economic models to reward uploaders and regulate content consumption.

### Solution Overview
This proof of concept demonstrates a token-enabled decentralized file-sharing platform on the BSV blockchain. Users earn tokens by uploading content and spend tokens to access files shared by others. Integration with BSV Desktop wallet and the PushDrop protocol enables seamless token minting, transfer, and value exchange, illustrating practical mechanisms for decentralized economies in file sharing.

### Key Benefits
- **Incentivized Sharing**: Encourages content contributions through earned token rewards.
- **Controlled Access**: Users spend tokens to access valuable content, enabling fair exchange.
- **Decentralized Economy**: Supports token minting and transfer purely on the blockchain, eliminating intermediaries.
- **User-Friendly Wallet Integration**: BSV Desktop provides a seamless payment and management experience.

## Business Impact

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Content creators and consumers in decentralized networks
- **Secondary**: Developers building blockchain-based file sharing and content platforms
