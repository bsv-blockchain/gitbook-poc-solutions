# Natural Chain

A natural gas supply chain proof of concept system leveraging the BSV blockchain that creates an incentivized data-provenance tracking for methane emissions across different supply chain stages. The demo shows how each party can view history, confirm/acknowledge receipt of items, triggering new transaction states with unique transaction IDs (txid).
