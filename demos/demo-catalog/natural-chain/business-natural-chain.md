## Executive Summary

Natural Chain is a blockchain-enabled solution for tracking natural gas lifecycle data to ensure data integrity and enable carbon credit creation. By leveraging the Bitcoin SV blockchain, Natural Chain provides a transparent, immutable record of natural gas production, processing, and emissions, supporting environmental monitoring and regulatory compliance.

---

## Problem Statement

Tracking and verifying the lifecycle of natural gas is critical for sustainability and regulatory reporting but is hindered by data fragmentation, lack of trust, and manual processes. Inaccurate reporting can harm climate initiatives and result in regulatory risks.

Natural Chain addresses these challenges by capturing natural gas-related data on the blockchain, ensuring it is tamper-proof and auditable, paving the way for reliable carbon credit generation.
