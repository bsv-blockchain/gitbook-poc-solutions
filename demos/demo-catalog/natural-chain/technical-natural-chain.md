## Overview

Natural Chain is a blockchain-based application for capturing natural gas-related environmental data on the Bitcoin SV blockchain. It ensures data integrity and supports carbon credit creation through tokenization and immutable record-keeping.

---

## Features

- Immutable blockchain records for natural gas lifecycle data
- Token-based system for carbon credit creation and tracking
- Web-based dashboard for monitoring and data entry
- Real-time transparency and audit logging
- Integration with Bitcoin SV blockchain for secure anchoring

---

## System Architecture

### Frontend (TypeScript, React)

- User interface for environmental data capture and visualization
- Token and carbon credit management dashboard
- Real-time updates of blockchain status related to data entries

### Backend (Node.js, Express)

- REST APIs for data submission, token issuance, and queries
- Blockchain integration to anchor data on BSV network
- Database management for metadata and off-chain information

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Familiarity with BSV blockchain basics

### Running Locally
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser to access the application.

- Tokenization prevents fraudulent issuing of carbon credits
- Secure authentication and authorization for data access

---

## Testing & Validation

- Unit and integration tests for API and blockchain interaction
- Manual testing for UI workflows and token lifecycle

---

## Performance & Scalability

- Scalable backend architecture with Node.js and MongoDB
- Efficient blockchain integration for frequent anchoring
- Designed for extensibility with other environmental data sources

---

## Troubleshooting & Support

- Check logs for API and blockchain errors
- Validate blockchain connectivity and transaction status
- Use issue tracker on GitHub for reporting
