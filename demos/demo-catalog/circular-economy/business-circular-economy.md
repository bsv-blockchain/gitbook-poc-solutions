# Circular Economy - From Bottle to Body - Business Overview

**Demo ID**: `demo-2025-11`
**Status**: `Not Started`
**Last Updated**: `2025-09-05`

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The fashion industry faces a significant sustainability challenge due to waste, lack of supply chain transparency, and greenwashing. Consumers increasingly demand proof of environmental claims and responsible production practices, but many brands lack reliable and verifiable traceability mechanisms.

### Solution Overview
This proof of concept uses the BSV blockchain to ensure full transparency and traceability in circular fashion — tracking recycled plastic waste from bottle collection in London through every stage of its transformation into high-fashion garments. Each step is immutably recorded on-chain, providing consumers with verifiable proof of sustainability claims and empowering informed purchasing decisions.

### Key Benefits
- **End-to-End Traceability**: Immutable records of every step in the recycling and manufacturing process.
- **Consumer Trust**: Verifiable sustainability claims combat greenwashing and build confidence.
- **Environmental Impact**: Supports circular economy principles by closing the loop from waste to wearable products.
- **Brand Differentiation**: Positions brands as leaders in sustainability and transparency.

## Business Impact

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Fashion brands focused on sustainability and circular economy, environmentally conscious consumers
- **Secondary**: Regulators, sustainability certification bodies, supply chain partners
