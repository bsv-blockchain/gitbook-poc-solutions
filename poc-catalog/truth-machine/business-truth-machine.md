## Executive Summary

Truth Machine uses the BSV blockchain to secure digital files by recording their cryptographic hashes on-chain. This creates a permanent, tamper-proof proof that a file existed at a specific time and has not been altered since.

---

## Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to prove the authenticity and creation time of important digital documents. Traditional storage methods are vulnerable to tampering, accidental deletion, or disputes. Truth Machine solves this by providing immutable, verifiable evidence anchored on the blockchain.

---

## How It Works

- Files are uploaded and their hash is recorded on the BSV blockchain.
- The original files are stored securely off-chain.
- At any time, users can verify a fileâ€™s integrity by comparing it with the blockchain record.
- A Treasury system funds blockchain transaction fees transparently, ensuring ongoing operation.

---

## Key Benefits

- **Immutable Proof**: Once recorded, data cannot be changed or deleted without detection.
- **Trust & Compliance**: Provides reliable audit trails supporting legal and regulatory needs.
- **Cost-Effective**: Blockchain fees managed by a tokenized treasury, avoiding surprise costs.
- **Easy Verification**: Users can independently confirm data authenticity anytime.
