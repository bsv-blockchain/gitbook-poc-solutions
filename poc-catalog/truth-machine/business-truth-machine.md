# Truth Machine - Business Overview

**POC ID**: `POC-2025-001`
**Status**: `Pilot`
**Last Updated**: `August 2025`

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The Truth Machine application addresses the need for **secure data integrity and trusted timestamping** using blockchain technology. It solves the problem of proving the existence and integrity of digital files at a specific point in time with immutable evidence.

### Solution Overview
This application demonstrates how to securely upload a file, then record its cryptographic hash on the Bitcoin SV blockchain to create an immutable proof of existence timestamp. Files are stored securely and can be retrieved later, providing verifiable evidence of their creation date and integrity to stakeholders.

### Key Benefits
- Immutable proof of file existence and integrity using blockchain
- Transparent and verifiable timestamping
- Ability to fund operational costs via token creation for transaction fees
- Supports secure document management with cryptographic assurance

## Business Impact

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Enterprises requiring secure document timestamping and verification
- **Secondary**: Developers and blockchain service providers demonstrating trusted data solutions

### Success & Usage Insights
- In active production use by businesses seeking secure timestamping
- Files cryptographically hashed and anchored on BSV blockchain for immutable audit trails
- Treasury system funds transaction fees via token mechanisms to ensure cost transparency and sustainability
